  This is the game project for my second job, where I worked as a programmer in NetEase, for the Chinese mobile version of Microsoft's 'Minecraft' C++ Edition (distributed by NetEase Interactive Entertainment).
  My responsibilities included developing and maintaining the SDK program provided to mod developers, solve bugs, optimize the computational efficiency of the game. Additionally, I contributed to the creation of official expanded gameplay for the Chinese version of 'Minecraft'. Below url are two official mod gameplay features I helped develop.
  I subsequently participated in another game project at NetEase, which is a 3D party game developed using the UE4 engine. The gameplay is similar to 'Bed Wars' in Minecraft, but as this project is still in development, it cannot be showcased due to confidentiality reasons.
