"Touch ⠞⠕⠥⠉⠓" is a 2D top-down, narrative-driven maze exploration game. ⠞⠕⠥⠉⠓ represents "Touch" in Braille.

I made it in the 48h GIGA game jam, 2023/7/7-2023/7/9, in China GuangZhou-TianHe. The gamejam title is "Touch", this project achieved third place in the game jam site.

<!-- 玩法 -->
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">How to play:</span><br/>

Players take on the role of a blind character, interpreting Braille by touch, reading letters exchanged with a loved one. They explore a nostalgic city district (maze) in memory, gradually recalling familiar streets and past moments spent with their loved one.

The game consists of three levels, showcasing three Braille letters themed around "Romance," "Separation", and "Reunion."

Controls: Move using WASD, and use the M key to open the map for recollection. By clicking the left mouse button, the player uses the cane to gain brief moments of vision.

Anxiety Mechanism: While exploring the old city district within memory, each click or encounter with danger increases the player's anxiety.

Recollection Mechanism: The paths the player walks are retained. Opening the map allows players to compare "Explored Paths" with "Streets in Memory" to find their location and navigate the maze quickly. When the player becomes anxious, the map opens, compelling them to recollect involuntarily.

<!-- 职责 -->
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">My part</span><br/>

There are 5 people in the game jam team. 2 2D-artist, 1 programmer, 1 musician, 1 level designer. Most of the team members besides me are students.

I'm the programmer and also responsible for the foundational design of game mechanics, such as using clicks to dispel fog, interacting with scene objects to alter anxiety levels, and comparing walked paths to a simplified map. However, I'm not in charge of level design or story writing.

<!-- 改进 -->
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Playtest and Improve</span><br/>
The game was playtested and showcased at the game jam site. After the game jam ended, it was also made available online and shared with friends for playtesting. Some feedback was collected, and these were the most frequently mentioned points:
1. The story is short and lacks relevance to puzzle-solving.
2. Levels are linear, allowing players to reach the end without relying on memory or comparing maps.
3. There's a scarcity of interactive elements within the maps.
Therefore, for future improvements, I may consider the following optimizations: adding more branching paths within the maps, widening the roads, and introducing traffic lights, moving pedestrians, and vehicles. When players interact with items in the game or the map, incorporating more story-related memories and collectible CG picture fragments could be beneficial.
