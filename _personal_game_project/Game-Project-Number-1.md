"Touch ⠞⠕⠥⠉⠓" is a 2D top-down, narrative-driven maze exploration game. ⠞⠕⠥⠉⠓ represents "Touch" in Braille.

Players take on the role of a blind character, interpreting Braille by touch, reading letters exchanged with a loved one. They explore a nostalgic city district (maze) in memory, gradually recalling familiar streets and past moments spent with their loved one.

The game consists of three levels, showcasing three Braille letters themed around "Romance," "Separation," and "Reunion."

Controls: Move using WASD, click the mouse to disperse fog, and use the M key to open the map for recollection.

Anxiety Mechanism: While exploring the old city district within memory, each click or encounter with danger increases the player's anxiety.

Recollection Mechanism: The paths the player walks are retained. Opening the map allows players to compare "Explored Paths" with "Streets in Memory" to find their location and navigate the maze quickly. When the player becomes anxious, the map opens, compelling them to recollect involuntarily.
