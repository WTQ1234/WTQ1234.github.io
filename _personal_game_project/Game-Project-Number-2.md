"Dice Fight" is a 2D platform pvp game, looks like "Ultimate Chicken Horse" or "Stick Fight: The Game".

I made it in the 3 weeks booom game jam, 2023/9/20-2023/10/11, online. The gamejam title is "Unfair Randomness".

<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">How to play:</span><br/>

Player place traps to hurt others, and weapons falls from sky.

The clock rotating once in the scene changes the number of weapons a player can hold, causing random fluctuations.

Controls: Due to development constraints, only two-player co-op on the same device is supported. The left player uses WASD to move, F for melee weapons, and G for ranged weapons. The right player uses arrow keys to move, Numpad 3 for melee weapons, and Enter on the right side for ranged weapons.

<br/><img src="/images/IMG_Game_Project_2_2.png" style="width: 640px; height: auto;">

The game is played in a best-of-three format. Before each round, players can acquire three traps and strategically place them within the scene. Following this preparation phase, the combat phase begins.

The player's hands display indicates the maximum number of weapons they can carry, determined by the dice roll outcome during each reset. Striking the hanging clock speeds up the countdown for the dice reset. The color of the player's hands represents the durability of held weapons or bullet count, transitioning from green to red as ammunition depletes.

<!-- 职责 -->
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">My part</span><br/>

There are 6 people in the game jam team: 2 2D-artist, 1 animator(Spine), 1 3D-artist, 1 musician, 2 programmer. Everyone else in the team besides me are students.

I'm one of the programmer, responsible for half of the programming work, mainly focusing on combat and core gameplay. Additionally, I handle game mechanics and numerical design, such as randomizing the weapons players can hold when the countdown reaches zero, triggering the clock by attacking to speed up the countdown. I also determine the weapons' drop rates, bullet counts, damage, and other weapon-specific values. Other teammates handle the design of weapon animations, attack styles, trap mechanisms, and more.

The game jam cost 3 weeks, due to changing work and moving back home, my actual work time is about one week.

<!-- 改进 -->
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Playtest and Improve</span><br/>

The game was playtested and showcased at the game jam site. After the game jam ended, it was also made available online and shared with friends for playtesting. Some feedback was collected, and these were the most frequently mentioned points:
1. Insufficient variety in traps and weapons, lacking significant differences between them.
2. Difficulty in depleting held melee weapons when wanting to switch to better weapons.
3. Melee weapons are relatively weak and have trouble hitting enemies.
Therefore, for future improvements, I may consider the following optimizations: enhancing melee weapons by introducing a wider variety with different effects such as explosions, freezing, poisoning, etc. Additionally, adding crates that can be shattered using melee weapons to drop supplies might help players consume unwanted melee weapons they pick up while searching for better options.
