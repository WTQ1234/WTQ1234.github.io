ZumaCard is a 2D strategy pve game. Enemies are automatically generated through tracks and move toward the player. The player releases spells to incite the enemy to help him fight.

I made it by myself and not in a game jam.

<!-- 玩法 -->
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">How to play:</span><br/>

Enemies will move towards the player via tracks similar to those in Zuma.

Players can click on enemies and consume mana to instigate enemies, and mana will be automatically restored over time.

There are 3 types of enemies: spear/axe/sword. Spears beat swords, swords beat axes, axes beat spears. Attacking a restrained enemy can result in a critical hit.

I design and made it by myself, but the picture is from internet.

<!-- 改进 -->
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Playtest and Improve</span><br/>

The game was available online and shared with friends for playtesting. Some feedback was collected, and these were the most frequently mentioned points:
1. No chain elimination mechanism like in Zuma.
2. The design of the track in the level has nothing to do with the game mechanism. Players can directly click to instigate rebellion, and there is no missing click.
3. When the controlled soldier rolls back, it will lose blood when it hits other enemies. This mechanism is rather strange.
Therefore, for future improvements, I might consider the following optimizations: 
1. Add more enemy types and abilities, such as archers who can fight from a distance.
2. When the controlled soldiers defeat the enemy, upgrade them to achieve the effect of continuous defeat.
3. Add other magic for players besides inciting enemies to rebel, such as shooting a bullet, etc., and change the magic to manual aiming and firing, so that the level design can be more strategic.
