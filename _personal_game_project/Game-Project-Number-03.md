Flying Axe is a 2D platform pve game, looks like "Vampire Survivors".

I made it by myself and not in a game jam.

<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">How to play:</span><br/>

The player throws a flying axe to damage enemies and retrieves the spinning axe by jumping.

Enemies come in three types: melee, charging melee, and bullet shooters. When enemies die, they drop coins and health points. Collecting coins to upgrade, strengthening the player.

If the player falls, they will respawn at the starting point and lose health.

Controls: Uses WASD to move, click left mouse button to attack, click the right mouse button to dash.

I design and made it by myself, but the picture is from internet.

<!-- 改进 -->
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Playtest and Improve</span><br/>

The game was available online and shared with friends for playtesting. Some feedback was collected, and these were the most frequently mentioned points:
1. The game's difficulty is quite high.
2. Upgrades provide weak feedback and there's a lack of attack options.
3. Limited variation in the map design.
4. The sprint mechanism is incomplete and often results in collisions with monsters, causing damage.
Therefore, for future improvements, I might consider the following optimizations: 
1. Adjusting values to decrease difficulty, reducing the occurrence of monsters (bats) using sprint attacks.
2. introducing more types of axes as upgrades (e.g., axes causing freezing or flame effects).
3. adding a Boss, and altering the map. My current idea involves transforming the map into a tower where players need to continuously jump upward, climbing through layers of the tower. Each ascended layer would be considered a level passed, offering an opportunity for an upgrade.
