Flying Axe is a 2D platform pve game, looks like "Vampire Survivors".

Player place traps to hurt others, and weapons falls from sky.

The clock rotating once in the scene changes the number of weapons a player can hold, causing random fluctuations.

Controls: Uses WASD to move, click left mouse button to attack, click the right mouse button to dash.

The game is played in a best-of-three format. Before each round, players can acquire three traps and strategically place them within the scene. Following this preparation phase, the combat phase begins.
