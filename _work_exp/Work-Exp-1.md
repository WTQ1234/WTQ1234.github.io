  This is the game project for my first job, a 3D top-down MMO-ARPG game for cell phone, published by ByteDance (TikTok). Unfortunately, the game has been shut down, and I couldn't find the English version of this game.
  I worked as a programmer on this project for 2 years (June 2020 - April 2022). The project team consisted of a total of 11 programmers, with 6-7 handling game logic development.
  I was responsible for approximately 10% of the game logic development, including systems for combat, guidance, social interaction, and character development, as well as supporting tasks like database management and data analytics. The most complex module I handled was the new player guidance system.
